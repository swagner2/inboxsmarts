About LittleHunter:
LittleHunter is a pet food brand competing in a crowded market against established players. With a focus on quality and care for pets, they aimed to scale their business rapidly but faced significant challenges with their email marketing and automation systems.

The Challenge:
When LittleHunter engaged [Your Name], they were generating just $850/month in revenue and had a few broken email flows.
