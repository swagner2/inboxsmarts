The Challenge:
Vurbmoto needed tools to support their transition from a content-driven platform to a thriving e-commerce ecosystem. They wanted to leverage contests and events to engage their audience, increase sales, and foster brand loyalty. However, they required a solution that could integrate their online store, contests, and sponsorship obligations seamlessly.

Challenges and Pain Points
	1.	Contests and Loyalty:
Vurbmoto ran contests to engage their audience, but needed a way to connect these efforts with their e-commerce goals, encouraging contest participants to make purchases and stay engaged long-term.
	2.	Event Integration:
At motocross events, they wanted to capture participant and attendee data effortlessly while complying with contest rules and sponsor requirements.
	3.	E-Commerce Transition:
As a new e-commerce player, Vurbmoto required a scalable platform to manage sales and customer data while maintaining their focus on community-driven activities.


“Working with Steven was a game changer for us. He didn’t just set us up with Klaviyo — he helped us reimagine how we engage with our audience. From events to contests to loyalty programs, every piece now works together seamlessly. We’ve grown our business and strengthened our community at the same time.”
— Brent Stallo, Vurbmoto
