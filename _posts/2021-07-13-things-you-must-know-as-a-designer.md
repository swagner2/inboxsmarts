Goli, a well-known wellness brand, recently achieved something remarkable—generating over $3 million in sales in just 30 days through TikTok Shop. Even more impressive, Goli did this with a brand-new strategy that’s quickly disrupting the way brands operate on the platform. By tapping into the power of affiliate marketing incentives and creating an effective setup for TikTok Shop, Goli has set a new benchmark for e-commerce success on TikTok. Here’s a deep dive into their strategy and the lessons your business can take from it.

**1. Building a Standout TikTok Shop Listing**
Goli began by designing a well-crafted product listing that stands out on TikTok Shop. They included high-quality images and powerful messaging, emphasizing their position as “America’s #1 Ashwagandha Vitamin Gummy Brand” to build credibility. Every aspect of their listing, from lifestyle images to detailed product benefits, was optimized to appeal to TikTok’s audience. They also included purchase incentives—such as discounts for adding multiple items to the cart—to boost average order value.

**2. Choosing High-Demand Products**
Goli focused on their top-selling items—Ashwagandha gummies, apple cider vinegar gummies, and sleep gummies—and bundled them into packs. By leveraging their most popular products and creating bundle options, they effectively increased the attractiveness of their offerings and gave customers more options to purchase in bulk, further boosting average order value.

**3. Unique Affiliate Incentives to Spark Explosive Growth**
One of the main reasons behind Goli’s rapid sales growth was their innovative affiliate incentive program, the first of its kind on TikTok Shop. Goli introduced tiered incentives for affiliates who hit specific sales milestones, offering rewards that included high-end prizes like iPhones, MacBooks, retreats, and even a Tesla. These rewards created excitement and motivated affiliates to promote Goli’s products aggressively.

They took this strategy a step further by building anticipation through social proof. Goli connected with TikTok communities, held live Twitter spaces, and shared brand insights to assure affiliates that these rewards were real, which built trust and created a sense of urgency among affiliates to participate.

**4. Fostering a Community of Micro-Influencers**
Goli partnered with over 4,000 creators to promote their products on TikTok Shop. They relied heavily on micro-influencers—creators with under 70,000 followers—proving that you don’t need to work with large influencers to achieve big results. By sourcing micro-influencers through an agency, Goli was able to launch a large volume of content that felt authentic to TikTok users.

**5. Thorough Preparation and Training for Creators**
To ensure consistency and accuracy in messaging, Goli provided creators with a brand guide and trend insights before product arrival. This included background information on the brand, best practices, and examples of successful TikTok videos. They even shared a list of do’s and don’ts to ensure creators stayed compliant. By educating affiliates on the brand’s mission and products, Goli empowered them to create high-quality, on-brand content that resonated with viewers.

**6. Scaling Success with Paid Ads**
Goli didn’t stop at organic content. Whenever a video performed well organically, they invested in it by running it as a paid ad. By taking their top-performing content and scaling it with paid ads, Goli ensured these videos reached a larger audience and continued generating revenue. This dual approach—organic reach followed by paid amplification—helped Goli maximize their return on each piece of content.

**7. Adding Urgency to Drive Immediate Action**
Another key to Goli’s success was their use of urgency. They made it clear that their affiliate incentives were only available for a limited time. This deadline created a sense of urgency among affiliates, encouraging them to act quickly to secure rewards. This approach contributed to a sharp rise in engagement and sales, especially in the early stages of the campaign.

**8. Doubling Down with Even Bigger Incentives**
After their initial success, Goli decided to scale even further by offering even more impressive incentives, such as a Lamborghini Urus and a condominium in Brickell, Miami. By raising the stakes, they ensured ongoing excitement and commitment from affiliates, demonstrating how scaling up rewards can sustain momentum.

**Key Takeaways for E-commerce Brands**
Goli’s TikTok Shop success story offers valuable lessons for any e-commerce business looking to break into the platform:
	1.	Create a High-Quality, Clear Product Listing: Make sure your product images, descriptions, and features are designed to build credibility and encourage higher cart values.
	2.	Utilize Popular Products and Bundles: Start with high-demand products and offer bundle packs to increase average order value and appeal to a wider audience.
	3.	Motivate Affiliates with Tangible Incentives: Implement a tiered incentive program with valuable rewards to inspire affiliates to drive significant sales for your brand.
	4.	Work with Micro-Influencers: Partner with micro-influencers for authentic content that resonates with TikTok’s user base, even if they have smaller followings.
	5.	Prepare and Train Your Affiliates: Provide a brand guide and trend insights to help affiliates create engaging, on-brand content that connects with your audience.
	6.	Leverage Organic Success with Paid Ads: Boost high-performing content with paid ads to expand your reach and capitalize on viral moments.
	7.	Build Urgency into Your Campaign: Set time limits on rewards or promotions to drive immediate action and engagement from affiliates and customers.

Goli’s innovative approach has not only set a new standard on TikTok Shop but also provides a blueprint for other brands aiming to achieve rapid growth on the platform. Their success shows that with the right combination of affiliate incentives, brand transparency, and well-executed marketing strategies, any e-commerce business can thrive on TikTok Shop.
